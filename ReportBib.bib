abstract = {Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy giving rise to one of the most indolent solid cancers, but also one of the most lethal. In recent years, systematic studies of the cancer genome, most importantly those derived from The Cancer Genome Altas (TCGA), have catalogued aberrations in the DNA, chromatin, and RNA of the genomes of thousands of tumors relative to matched normal cellular genomes and have analyzed their epigenetic and protein consequences. Cancer genomics is therefore providing new information on cancer development and behavior, as well as new insights into genetic alterations and molecular pathways. From this genomic perspective, we will review the main advances concerning some essential aspects of the molecular pathogenesis of thyroid cancer such as mutational mechanisms, new cancer genes implicated in tumor initiation and progression, the role of non-coding RNA, and the advent of new susceptibility genes in thyroid cancer predisposition. This look across these genomic and cellular alterations results in the reshaping of the multistep development of thyroid tumors and offers new tools and opportunities for further research and clinical development of novel treatment strategies.},

abstract = {Thyroid neoplasias have been largely ignored as an active field of investigation due to the overall favorable prognosis of differentiated nonmedullary thyroid cancers. However, differentiated thyroid cancers have the highest estimated annual percentage increase in incidence amongst all cancer sites. Furthermore, no significant progress has been made to improve survival, especially for advanced disease. Compounding the problem, there remains a lack of highly accurate preoperative markers or molecular-based predictive models to differentiate benign from malignant follicular neoplasias, thus we continue to rely upon surgery for diagnostic purposes in this subset of patients. Therefore, new approaches are necessary to identify potential novel diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic algorithms, which would not only allow accurate early diagnosis but also personalized patient management, with clinical management and surveillance tailored according to the genetic signature of the patient. The advent of modern genomic technologies, such as global gene-expression profiling, may begin to provide the data required for the evidence-based practice of genomic medicine as it relates to thyroid neoplasia. However, it is already clear that genomic technology alone is insufficient to fully achieve this vision.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The incidence of papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) is rapidly increasing in Korea. Analyzing the gene expression profiling (GEP) of PTCs will facilitate the advent of new methods in diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment. We performed this study to find the GEP of Korean PTCs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We performed oligonucleotide microarray analysis with 19 PTCs and 7 normal thyroid glands. Differentially expressed genes were selected using a t-test (|fold| {\textgreater}3) and adjusted Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate P-value {\textless} 0.01. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) was used to validate microarray data. A classification model was developed by support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to diagnose PTCs based on molecular signatures.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We identified 79 differentially expressed genes (70 up-regulated and 9 down-regulated) according to the criteria. QRT-PCR for five genes (CDH3, NGEF, PROS1, TGFA, MET) was confirmatory of the microarray data. Hierarchical cluster analysis and a classification model by the SVM algorithm accurately differentiated PTCs from normal thyroid gland based on GEP.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: A disease classification model showed excellent accuracy in diagnosing PTCs, thus showing the possibility of molecular diagnosis in the future. This GEP could serve as baseline data for further investigation in the management of PTCs based on molecular signatures.},

abstract = {Thyroid cancer is a common endocrine malignancy. There has been exciting progress in understanding its molecular pathogenesis in recent years, as best exemplified by the elucidation of the fundamental role of several major signalling pathways and related molecular derangements. Central to these mechanisms are the genetic and epigenetic alterations in these pathways, such as mutation, gene copy-number gain and aberrant gene methylation. Many of these molecular alterations represent novel diagnostic and prognostic molecular markers and therapeutic targets for thyroid cancer, which provide unprecedented opportunities for further research and clinical development of novel treatment strategies for this cancer.},

@article{Durante2006,
abstract = {AIM: The goal of this study was to estimate the cumulative activity of (131)I to be administered to patients with distant metastases from thyroid carcinoma. METHODS: A total of 444 patients were treated from 1953-1994 for distant metastases from papillary and follicular thyroid carcinoma: 223 had lung metastases only, 115 had bone metastases only, 82 had both lung and bone metastases, and 24 had metastases at other sites. Treatment consisted of the administration of 3.7 GBq (100 mCi) (131)I after withdrawal of thyroid hormone treatment, every 3-9 months during the first 2 yr and then once a year until the disappearance of any metastatic uptake. Thyroxine treatment was given at suppressive doses between (131)I treatment courses. RESULTS: Negative imaging studies (negative total body (131)I scans and conventional radiographs) were attained in 43{\%} of the 295 patients with (131)I uptake; more frequently in those who were younger, had well-differentiated tumors, and had a limited extent of disease. Most negative studies (96{\%}) were obtained after the administration of 3.7-22 GBq (100-600 mCi). Almost half of negative studies were obtained more than 5 yr after the initiation of the treatment of metastases. Among patients who achieved a negative study, only 7{\%} experienced a subsequent tumor recurrence. Overall survival at 10 yr after initiation of (131)I treatment was 92{\%} in patients who achieved a negative study and 19{\%} in those who did not. CONCLUSION: (131)I treatment is highly effective in younger patients with (131)I uptake and with small metastases. They should be treated until the disappearance of any uptake or until a cumulative activity of 22 GBq has been administered. In the other patients, other treatment modalities should be used when tumor progression has been documented.},

@misc{Kitahara2016,
abstract = {During the past few decades, the incidence of thyroid cancer has increased substantially in many countries, including the USA. The rise in incidence seems to be attributable both to the growing use of diagnostic imaging and fine-needle aspiration biopsy, which has led to enhanced detection and diagnosis of subclinical thyroid cancers, and environmental factors. The latest American Thyroid Association (ATA) practice guidelines for the management of adult patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer differ substantially from the previous ATA guidelines published in 2009. Specifically, the problems of overdiagnosis and overtreatment of a disease that is typically indolent, where treatment-related morbidity might not be justified by a survival benefit, now seem to be acknowledged. As few modifiable risk factors for thyroid cancer have been established, the specific environmental factors that have contributed to the rising incidence of thyroid cancer remain speculative. However, the findings of several large, well-designed epidemiological studies have provided new information about exposures (such as obesity) that might influence the development of thyroid cancer. In this Review, we describe the changing incidence of thyroid cancer, suggest potential explanations for these trends, emphasize the implications for patients and highlight ongoing and potential strategies to combat this growing clinical and public health issue.},
